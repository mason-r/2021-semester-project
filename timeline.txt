This is a timeline of major events in my project. This is not vital information and is for reference purposes only.

8/19/21: Beginning of project. Brainstorm document created. Many things planned: overall concepts, modification options, score changers, and more
8/25/21: Added a list of songs I want to add. Notable examples include the planned hardest song Hello (BPM) 2021 by Camellia and the obligatory Freedom Dive.
8/27/21 (1): Completed prototype note shapes. Default notes are simple blue circles with dark blue border; anti-notes are very dark red with a dripping effect.
8/27/21 (2): Scrapped prototype note shapes because the program I used turned out to be really bad for making graphics.
8/27/21 (3): Began experimenting with vector graphics software. Default note finished since it's literally just two circles.
8/30/21: Finished prototype notes with vector graphics this time.
